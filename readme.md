### 2022/22/22 14:00 - Ben: Finishing Research on Tiles

Resources:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGleQZVgdN4&list=PLBIb_auVtBwCKQk6blxNPYC5GEuaC4DGm&index=1 (Playlist linked for Tutorials on Game development for Mobile with Unity)


I finished up my reasearch on using tiles and tile managing.

I primarily used a video on generating infinite tiles which will be useful for our game this video was in 3D.

It will have to be converted to 2.5-2D for our purposes.

The obstacles in the game will have coliders, padding, and various interactions with the dog and sheep.

Did Additional Research on developing mobile apps in Unity and testing of them.

---

### 2022/02/22 10:00 - Fritz: Digital Concept Diagrams

I came up with the following concept diagram to try modelling a possible schema of how we will be organizing our data within the game, and how this layer will communicate with different components of the game. 

<img src="./assets/fritz diagram 1.jpg" alt="fritz diagram 1.jpg"
title="fritz diagram 1.jpg" width="420" height="377"/>

I also explored and messed around with Serialization, and came up with some codes on how we might be able to use Binary Serialization instead of Unity’s PlayerPrefs to store data of different types in a more efficient, and secure manner.

### 2022/20/22 13:10 - Ben: Created Chunk Concept Diagram

Created the Following Chunk Concept Diagram.

<img src="./assets/Procedural Generation Concept Chunk Based.jpeg" alt="Procedural Generation Concept Chunk Based.jpeg"
title="Procedural Generation Concept Chunk Based.jpeg" width="1008" height="756"/>

Sketched gameplay and ways of deleting based on research.

Created Using LucidChart.

### 2022/02/18 19:00 - Alex: Udemy Course Part 2

I spent another 30 min on the project doing the next 3 videos of the Udemy course which were instantiating enemies, coroutines, and while loops. Again, just trying to learn the system before going straight to my task. Its going smoothly as of right now. It takes you step by steps in the videos but don’t feel super comfortable with the information.

---

### 2022/02/18 14:00 - Fritz: Sketching Diagrams and Exploring Requirements

I went into a room and sketched what I thought the requirements of the game could look like in the game.

### 2022/02/17 19:00 - Alex: Udemy Course Part 1

I spent about 30 min again on our project. I continued the Udemy course on the laser defender. The videos I watched today was the boundaries, enemies, and pathfinding. I’m just trying to learn the basics of Unity before trying to focus on my specific task after yesterday seeing animations can go in-depth.

---

### 2022/02/16 19:00 - Alex: Animation Timeline

Today I only spent about 30 minutes continuing my exploration of Unity. Today I focused more on the task I was given into the group which was Art Animations/ Polishing up. I found a video on YouTube that has of Animation basics in Unity. I was only able to get through the first video and get a true grasp of what he was explaining. This was more of timeline animation then actual programming animations.

### 2022/02/15 23:57 - Ben: Researched Chunk Spawning and Event Tracking

Resources:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjD_DwbYYcs

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2Rwsc0COqQ

Used Matt MirrorFish's video to do some researching on tracking spawning of chunks.
Began experimenting with the program myself in unity, watching the level be endlessly generator with the track.

Conclusion, Tracking of events, and destroying checks will be useful for the mobile app.

---

### 2022/02/15 9:00 - Alex: Unity Setup and Exploration

I spent about 40 min around the Unity program trying out different scenes, seeing what the program can do. I am also started in a section in Udemy creating a Laser Defender. I only got to finish up to the Unity Input System today.

### 2022/02/14 18:00 - Fritz: Reading and Studying Identified Resources

I went over all the identified resources on 2022/02/10 (link) and studied how I should approach the data management design of the game. I failed to take relevant notes but absorbed a lot of material that I think will help me come up with sketches in the future. I also jotted down a list of things I thought the game would need based on the diagrams our group sketched on the whiteboard in our first meeting. 

---

### 2022/02/12 11:22 - Ben: Began Working with Strata for Procedural Geneartion

Resources: 

https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/2d-procedural-generation-in-unity-with-scriptableobjects

Started trying to use strata to develop procedural levels, used this for roguelike duegueon development.

Used strata create various chunks of arrays to be used to generate additional chunks.

Coded a Test Environment for the Chunks, and created a test tile map.

Determined this might not be the best option for our purposes of Developing a mobile app.

---

### 2022/02/10 14:00 - Fritz: Finding Resources

I was told to focus my research on how to manage the scene and data management side of the game. 

I did some research on the topic, and identified a few good resources:

http://www.glenstevens.ca/unity3d-best-practices/
https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/assets-resources-and-assetbundles
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPhM8wNDNng
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hAzWgQupms

I did a quick read/glance over the material in the resource to determine whether it seemed useful or not but did not go through it properly as it was extensive. 

---

### 2022/02/10 9:23 - Ben: Udemy Course Learning

Watched 2 hours of video to farmilarize myself with Unity using the Udemy Laser Shooter Game as a platform.

---

### 2022/02/08 15:13 - Ben: Unity Project Journal Cloned

Cloned the journal from github and unity project from github and began research on procedural generation.

---

### 2022/02/07 13:30 - Fritz: Unity Project Setup

Cleared previous Github to start from a fresh slate.

Created the Unity Project we will be doing our learning in, and setup the Unity project for Git collaboration.

Created folders within the project for each team member to be able to work in, and not have to worry too much about conflicts.

As a group, we started figuring out how to use this journal, Ben was watching attentively, Noah directing us on what to do. Hopefully git is nice to us.

---

### 2022/02/07 11:25 - Deandra: Udemy course learning 

Completed one hour of Udemy course on game development. Attempted to create a laser shooter game.

[Markdown with HTML for image resizing](https://www.xaprb.com/blog/how-to-style-images-with-markdown/)


Following are some images of the whiteboard after our meeting to discuss design on Sunday (2022/02/06).  *Please note, the full sized images are available in the assests folder*:

Full Board:

I have created a repo for storing our journal.  I also animated our studio name and added it to the top of the journal.  I did a little research into markdown - particularly as implemented by GitHub.  The resources in the links above came from that effort.

There is some difficulty getting images to scale appropraitely in the document.  I have decided to use the HTML method outlined in the second link to address that issue.  It can also be avoided entirely by making sure the image size in the asset folder is the same size it should appear in the document.

We will use headers in our updates, so we can link to them later in the document.  I also suggest using 24hour time so we can avoid AM/PM abiguity.
