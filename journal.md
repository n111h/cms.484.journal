Following are some images of the whiteboard after our meeting to discuss design on Sunday (2022/02/06).  *Please note, the full sized images are available in the assests folder*:

I have created a repo for storing our journal.  I also animated our studio name and added it to the top of the journal.  I did a little research into markdown - particularly as implemented by GitHub.  The resources in the links above came from that effort.

There is some difficulty getting images to scale appropraitely in the document.  I have decided to use the HTML method outlined in the second link to address that issue.  It can also be avoided entirely by making sure the image size in the asset folder is the same size it should appear in the document.

We will use headers in our updates, so we can link to them later in the document.  I also suggest using 24hour time so we can avoid AM/PM abiguity.
